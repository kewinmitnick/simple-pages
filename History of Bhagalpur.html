The district of Bhagalpur is situated in the central part of Bhagalpur
     division. <br><br>The city of Bhagalpur is the headquarters of Bhagalpur 
     division as also of the district and Sadar subdivision. <br><br>There are 3 
     sub-divisions viz., Naugachia, Bhagalpur Sadar and Kahalgaon in the 
     district.<br><br> Number of C.D. Blocks in the district is 16. There are 1515 
     villages and 4 statutory towns in the district.The district of 
     Bhagalpur, as presently constituted, comprised the south-eastern part 
     of the Subah of Bihar in the Mughal times.<br><br> When the Diwani of Bihar, 
     Bengal and Orissa was granted to the East India Company in 1765, the 
     district consisted of a large area east of Sarkar Munger and, with the
      exception of Pargana Chhai, lay entirely south of the Ganges. This 
      also included Munger which was separated in 1832.<br><br>Santhal Pargana was 
      formed into a separate district in 1855-56. The area of the district 
      of the Ganges was thus greatly reduced. <br><br>In the year 1954, the entire 
      area north of the Ganges, with the exception of Bihpur, Naugachhia 
      and Gopalpur Police Stations was constituted into the new Saharsa \
      district. In the year 1991 Banka sub-division of the district was given
       the status of a district.Bhagalpur, as presently constituted, contains
        three subdivisions, viz., Bhagalpur Sadar, Naugachhia and Kahalgaon 
        consisting of 16 Community Development Block-cum-Anchals.<br><br>No authentic
         report is available as to the origin of the name of Bhagalpur. In 
         the Bengal District Gazetteer, Bhagalpur, 1911, it has rightly been 
         observed that the limits of the district of Bhagalpur being purely 
         artificial, no connected account of the territory that now bears 
         this name can be expected.<br><br> However, according to the District 
         Gazetteer of Bhagalpur (1962), Buchanan has observed in his journal
          that the name is said to have been given by the Mughal officers who
           collected a number of fugitives, and defended them in the plains 
           from the violence and depredations of the disorderly chiefs of 
           the interior.
